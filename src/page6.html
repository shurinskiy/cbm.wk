				<div class="i-tiles__text">We start with a knowledge transfer of your existing process to CBM, or the development of a de novo custom bioprocess from scratch. Our PD team then develops an optimal product strategy to align processes and equipment with future pilot scale and cGMP-scale operations.</div>

				<div class="i-tiles__text">Our viral vector process solutions are fully scalable. All upstream processes are are designed to meet safety, quality, and yield expectations and are scalable to phase-appropriate production volumes while maintaining critical quality attributes (CQAs) throughout the product lifecycle to commercialization.</div>

				<div class="i-tiles__text">Our PD and cGMP manufacturing teams closely collaborate and are cross-trained to ensure process performance and quality. CBM’s pilot plant operations support scale-up, scale-out, preclinical production, tech transfer, cGMP readiness, and training. From there, we seamlessly transfer your manufacturing process and scale up with pilot and training runs in one location to advance your project to cGMP production.</div>
